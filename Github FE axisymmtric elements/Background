Objectives:

Define 4 and 8 node rectangular elements that generate appropriate local stiffness matrices.
Apply suitable Gauss-Quadrature to generate relevant stiffness matrices.
Analyse simple 2D axisymmetric model of a thick wall with 1 inch inner radius and 2 inches outer radius.
Define an external load matrix (manually defined), solve the F = Ku equation to obtain the nodal deformation u.
Apply the results obtained to calculate the Stress at each Gauss point.

Compare results between a Five element strip of 4 node rectangles Vs 10 node rectangles.
Then compare results with a two element 8 node rectangle element system.

Observations:

All models were able to provide reasonable estimations for deflection.

However 5 element model stress results were not very accurate. (compared against exact/theory solution).

Increasing to 10 elements did not change the accuaracy of the stress estimations by much (although a slight improvement is noticed as 
seen in the spreadsheet of results.)

The two element 8 node rectangular set up seemed to be the best for both stress and deflection.

Also noticed that for two element 8 node set up the deformation was exactly as the theoretical calculations for a 2x2 Gauss points, 
but the stress was not very accuarte. 
For 3x3 Gauss points the deformation results were different from the theory (however not significantly different) and the stress was more
accurate.

Conclusions:

The reason for the 8 node elements to provide better results would have to do with the element being of higher order and less linear 
than a 4 node element. This observation demonstrates that mesh refinement is not always the best method to improve accuracy.

"Linear elements can give results for problems such as tempreature distribution, where nodal point results are of interest.
In any application where the derivative is the significant result, the analyst should be aware of the limitations of the linear 
formulations"
